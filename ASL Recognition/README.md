# Machine Vision-based American Sign Language (ASL) Translator

This code was built using the Digital Ocean article titled "How To Build a Neural Network to Translate Sign Language into English": https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-neural-network-to-translate-sign-language-into-english.

This translator is powered by OpenCV and using a deep neural network with PyTorch. The neural network is trained using the Sign Language MNIST, published by a user named "TECPERSON" on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist.
